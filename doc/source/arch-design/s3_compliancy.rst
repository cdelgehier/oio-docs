S3 Compliancy
=============

OpenIO SDS {{RELEASE}} is compliant with the most recent standards of request signatures:

- `Amazon S3 Signature v2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html>`_
- `Amazon S3 Signature v4 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html>`_

In addition to traditional path-style bucket naming, OpenIO SDS also
complies with host-style bucket naming as described in
`Virtual Hosting of Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html>`_.
