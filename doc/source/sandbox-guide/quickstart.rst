OpenIO SDS is a scalable open-source object storage solution.
It is compatible with Amazon S3 and OpenStack Swift.
Using OpenIO SDS, it is easy to scale a storage infrastructure from a simple cluster of a few terabytes to a multi-petabyte platform.
OpenIO SDS is hardware-agnostic and can be installed on both x86 and ARM hardware.
